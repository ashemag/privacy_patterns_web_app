COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S OPPOSITION TO 

RESPONDENT JERK, LLC'S SECOND MOTION TO EXTEND TIME TO 

ANSWER COMPLAINT COUNSEL'S SECOND REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS 

On December 22, 2014, the Court denied Jerk' s motion for an extension to answer 

Complaint Counsel's Request for Admissions, but gave Jerk a second chance to provide an 

explanation for refusing to participate in this case for five months.  Jerk has not complied with 

the Court's instruction.  Instead, Jerk's response reveals that Jerk has no legitimate explanation 

whatsoever.  It is now clear that Jerk refused to participate in this litigation with the deliberate 

intention of obstructing discovery and depriving Complaint Counsel of the ability to gather 

evidence.  The Court should deny Jerk's extension request. 

I. 

Jerk Has No Good-Faith Explanation For Its Delay. 

In denying Jerk's original motion, the Court explained that Jerk had "fail[ed]  to explain 

the reasons for its delay in retaining new counsel, or why such delay should be excused.  Jerk 

also fail[ed] to even acknowledge, much less justify, its fai lure to comply with existing discovery 

orders."  As a result, the Court instructed Jerk to provide "an explanation for its delay in 

PUBLIC 

obtaining new counsel, including all reasons therefor."  (Order of December 22, 2014) 

(emphasis added). 

Jerk's response does not comply with the Court's request.  Jerk's sole justification is that 

"the fact that [Jerk's previous counsel] was subjected to a deposition would make many attorneys 

less likely to take on Jerk's representation."  (Jerk' s Response dated January 5, 2015).  This 

speculative statement is no explanation at all.  The Court should disregard it for three reasons. 

First, Jerk does not say whether any potential counsel were in fact hesitant to represent 

Jerk because Ms. Speth sat for a deposition after she no longer represented Jerk. 1  Indeed, Jerk 

does not even say whether it approached any prospective counsel.  Notably, Jerk's present 

counsel does not contend that Ms. Speth's deposition affected their decision to represent Jerk. 

Second, even if Ms. Speth's deposition might have concerned some potential counsel, 

that deposition was not held until October 7-nearly three months after Ms. Speth announced 

Jerk's departure and Jerk stopped participating in this litigation.  Jerk's excuse-which is 

entirely hypothetical--cannot explain its dilatory conduct for those three months. 

Finally, the notion that Ms. Speth's deposition could render Jerk untouchable as a client 

strains credulity.  If that were the case, Jerk or Ms. Speth could have objected to her deposition 

or moved to quash the subpoena.  They did neither. 

Jerk' s filing thus falls far short of providing an explanation for Jerk's delay, as the Court 

requested.  In the face of Jerk's refusal to explain its conduct, the Court should conclude that 

1 Such a concern would, in this case, be entirely baseless.  Complaint Counsel made it 

clear that they decided to notice Ms. Speth for deposition only after Mr. Fanning testified under 
oath that Ms. Speth's role advising Jerk extended beyond that of Jerk's litigation counsel. 
(Burke Decl. Ex. B).  Mr. Fanning testified that he advised Ms. Speth while working for Jerk and 
that, in his opinion, she was best situated to describe Jerk's business.  (Burke Dec!. Ex. D). 
Jerk's suggestion that Complaint Counsel might have acted improperly by deposing Ms.  Speth is 
entirely unwarranted. 

2 

PUBLIC 

Jerk' s actions were (as they appear) designed to intentionally avoid resolution of this case on the 

merits .  This conclusion is supported by documents showing Respondent's intent to undermine 

the resolution of this action on the merits, such as John Fanning's email to Ms. Speth (while she 

still acted as Jerk's counsel) proposing to make a video for the purpose of becoming evidence in 

this case "just to fuck with [the FTC]."  (Burke Dec. Ex. A  [CX0072])_2 

II. 

Letting Jerk's Deemed Admissions Stand is Appropriate. 

Jerk's lack of a good-faith explanation for its misconduct separately justifies deeming the 

unanswered RFA's admitted.  In exercising its discretion under Commission Rule 3.32, "the 

d istrict court may consider other factors, including whether the moving party can show good 

cause for the delay  and whether the moving party appears to have a strong case on the merits." 

See Conlon v.  United States, 474 F.3d 616, 625 (9th Cir. 2007).  These discretionary factors lie at 

the core of the Court's questions in its December 22, 2014 Order. 

The Court should exercise its discretion to deny Jerk's motion.  The only  explanation for 

Jerk's lengthy disappearance and sudden reappearance-just a week after Complaint Counsel 

moved to admit Jerk' s deemed admissions into the record-is strategic gamesmanship  in bad 

faith.  In light of this track record, giving Jerk an opportunity to claw back its admissions and 

insulate itself from pretrial discovery would undercut the just resolution of this action.  (See 

Complaint Counsel Opposition dated December  16, 2014). 

Ill.  Conclusion 

For the reasons stated above, the Court should deny Jerk's motion for an extension of 

time to respond to Complaint Counsel' s Requests for Admission. 

2 This email was a topic of inquiry at Ms. Speth ' s deposition, after Mr. Fanning refused to testify 
about it.  Ms. Speth also refused to answer any questions about it.  Burke Decl. Ex. C.

This is an interesting idea.  The idea is that you make a video, and the video itself become 
evidence in a case. If the other side wants to depose the people in the video, then let them. We 
could try this approach with the FTC just to fuck with them.

Maria, 

I want to follow-up with you on the subpoena ad testificandum that you received yesterday.  Please note that we 
do not take sending a subpoena to opposing counsel lightly.  We also respect your choice to no longer represent 
Jerk and we had no intention to further involve you in the case, but Mr. Fanning shared some information 
during his deposition that suggested that your involvement with Jerk, LLC went beyond serving as counsel in 
this matter. 

We are happy to discuss alternate dates in early October if you are not available on September 30th.  Please 
contact me or Boris if you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter further. 

Best Regards, 
Sarah
